\subsection{Signal 1: quality of local renewable resources}

Consider a case when datacenters are located in Denmark, Germany, and Portugal (Figure \ref{fig:dashboard1}: panel a). There are three different types of renewable resources represented by the three sites, with Denmark having a good wind resource, Germany having a moderate wind and solar resources, and Portugal having a good solar resource. The quality of local renewable resources is reflected by the average annual capacity factor for onshore wind and solar PV, as shown in the panels b and c,

Panel d on Figure \ref{fig:dashboard1} shows the modelled cost-optimal capacity of renewable generators and battery storage for 24/7 matching. In the case of inflexible loads, the procurement strategy must ensure a sufficient amount of carbon-free electricity is available round-the-clock \textit{at each site}. Due to the non-dispatchable nature of renewable resources and the relatively high energy costs of battery storage, the cost-optimal portfolio is much larger than the load. To cover the 100 MW load with perfect hourly matching, the consumer would have to procure combined wind and solar PV generators of approx. 900~MW in Denmark and 1300~MW in Germany or Portugal. In each portfolio, the proportion of wind and solar PV reflects the quality of the local resources. 

In Figure \ref{fig:dashboard1}: panel d, steps on the x-axis represent increasing flexible load, allowing for a reduction in the capacity of renewable generators and battery storage necessary for 24/7 matching. By having a degree of load flexibility, a consumer can shift the load from times of scarce renewable generation to times of abundant renewable generation in the same hour, or use the excess renewable generation at one site to cover the load at another site. In other words, with load flexibility, consumer can get the most out of the clean energy resources that are available.

The breakdown of costs associated with procurement strategy that participating is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dashboard1}: panel e. The panel shows the average cost per MWh of consumption, including renewable generation costs and battery storage costs.\footnote{Here we do not consider the option of selling the excess electricity to the regional grid. Excess electricity can thus be stored in the battery, shifted in space or time with load flexibility, or curtailed.} Demand flexibility enables consumers to better match renewable generation with demand profile, reducing over-procurement and costly battery storage. The costs are reduced in all locations, and especially in locations where hourly matching is most expensive. Modelling results show the costs of 24/7 matching in Germany are at 215~\euro/MWh when there is no load flexibility, 135~\euro/MWh when there is 10\% flexible loads, and as reduced up to 137~\euro/MWh when there is 40\% of flexible loads.

Figure \ref{fig:dashboard1}: panel f displays the total annual costs for achieving 24/7 matching at all locations (left y-axis) and their relative representation as a percentage of the inflexible scenario costs (right y-axis). The panel summarises the model results: as demand flexibility increases, 24/7 matching becomes more resoure-efficient and affordable. The value of additional flexibility also diminishes as the number of flexible loads increases, i.e., the first 10\% of flexible loads can reduce costs more than the next 10\%. A generalization of this result is presented in Section \ref{ssec:section4}.
