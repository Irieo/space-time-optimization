% 1.1 Opening: ICT sector energy consumption and emissions

Modern technology has impacted almost every aspect of everyday life, leading to a rapidly growing demand for digital services. Internet users have doubled worldwide over the past decade, while traffic has grown 25-fold. \cite{ieaDataCentresData2023}
The significant energy consumption of the Information and Communications Technology (\gls{ict}) infrastructure is becoming a concern from the ecological standpoint.
Global datacenter energy use is estimated to be between 1\% and 2\% of the final electricity demand worldwide in 2020 \cite{davidmyttonHowMuchEnergy2020, masanetRecalibratingGlobalData2020} and is likely to increase rapidly in the future \cite{andraeGlobalElectricityUsage2015}. 
The Greenhouse Gas (\gls{ghg}) emissions footprint of the datacenters and data transmission networks was estimated at 330~million tones (Mt) \co-eq in 2020, equivalent to 0.9\% of global energy-related emissions. \cite{ieaDataCentresData2023, malmodinICTSectorElectricity2023} 
For perspective, the national CO$_2$ emissions of the United Kingdom were around 331~Mt in 2021. \cite{UKnationalstats} 

% **datacenter special features as electricity consumers*

The growing demand for computing drives innovation and economies of scale. Large companies, such as Amazon, Google, and Misrosoft are centralizing computing infrastructure into the \enquote{hyperscale} datacenters. 
Such large and highly efficient facilities consist of hundreds of server nodes, that are managed collectively and geographically dispersed throughout the world \cite{ThereAre500}. 

In their role as electricity consumers, hyperscale datacenters have unique characteristics when it comes to demand-side management. 
Some computing jobs and associated power loads are \enquote{flexible}, i.e., the jobs are not time-critical and can be scheduled flexibly without impacting the overall quality of service.
Therefore, datacenter operators have the ability to shift a considerable fraction of computing workloads \textit{in~time} and \textit{in space}. \cite{radovanovicIEEE2023} 
The temporal load shifting implies re-scheduling of flexible workloads to another time point, i.e., delaying computing job execution. 
The spatial load shifting implies migration of flexible compute jobs and associated power loads across physical datacenter locations. 

The significant energy consumption of \gls{ict} infrastructure, and its anticipated growth, raise a natural question: \textit{How can datacenters make use of unique spatial and temporal load-shifting capabilities to improve their economics and the environmental footprint?} The topic of this overarching question has been the subject of a growing body of literature over the past decade.

% Literature review
\textbf{Existing literature --} The work by Wierman et al.  \cite{wiermanOpportunitiesChallengesData2014} surveyed the forms, opportunities and challenges for data center demand response options, including aspects of temporal load shifting such as workload delaying or shedding and the geographical load balancing. Several papers discussed methods and policies needed to incentivise parcicipation of datacenters in the power grid's demand responce \cite{liuPricingDataCenter2014, zhouTruthfulEfficientIncentive2020}.

Numerous studies investigated ways to harness spatial or temporal load-shifting flexibility to achieve certain economical or environmental goals. Many studies have proposed workload scheduling algorithms for geographical load shifting to reduce datacenter electricity costs \cite{velascoElasticOperationsFederated2014, douCarbonAwareElectricityCost2017, heMinimizingOperationCost2021, raoDistributedCoordinationInternet2012, renCarbonAwareEnergyCapacity2012, dengEcoAwareOnlinePower2016}, or looked at the potential of datacenter load migration for mitigating renewable curtailment and \gls{ghg} emissions in the local electricity grid \cite{zhengMitigatingCurtailmentCarbon2020, mahmudDistributedFrameworkCarbon2016}, or aimed to increase a share of renewable energy in datacenter electricity consumption \cite{wangGreenawareVirtualMachine2015, kimDataCentersDispatchable2017, liuGeographicalLoadBalancing2011, kellyBalancingPowerSystems2016}.

Recently, several papers elaborated a mathematical problem that captures both spatial and temporal load-shifting flexibility. Zhang et al. \cite{zhangFlexibilityNetworksData2020} introduced the concept of virtual links to capture space-time load flexibility provided by geographically-distributed data centers in market clearing procedures. This work was followed by a follow-up paper, where authors elaborated an electricity market clearing formulation that seeks to remunerate spatio-temporal load shifting for the flexibility service datacenters can offer to the power grid \cite{zhangRemuneratingSpaceTime2022}.

A great deal of attention in previous research exploring the drivers for geograhical load shifting has focused on signals provided by the electricity grids where datacenters operate. These signals include average carbon emissions in the region of operation \cite{zhengMitigatingCurtailmentCarbon2020}, or locational marginal carbon emissions \cite{lindbergEnvironmentalPotentialHyperScale2021}, or locational electricity prices and price differences across datacenter locations \cite{raoMinimizingElectricityCost2010,tranHowGeoDistributedData2016, zhangRemuneratingSpaceTime2022}. This emerging stream of research work is now finding practical applications. For example, Google recently introduced a Carbon-Intelligent Compute Management system that minimizes carbon footprint and power infrastructure costs by shifting flexible workloads in time  across datacenter fleet as a function to the next day's carbon intensity forecasts. \cite{radovanovicIEEE2023} There are several companies providing market data and forecasts on carbon emissions and electricity prices, such as WattTime \cite{WattTime}, ElectricityMaps \cite{ElectricityMaps}, and others.

% 24/7 CFE**
\textbf{Towards clean computing--} The \gls{ict} companies invest significantly in renewable energy to reduce their environmental impact, reduce power price volatility, and enhance their brand image. The hyperscale datacenter industry in particular leads in corporate renewable energy acquisition through Power Purchase Agreements (\gls{ppa}s). With almost 50~GW contracted so far, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google are the four largest purchasers of corporate renewable energy PPAs. \cite{ieaDataCentresData2023} Furthermore, the leaders in corporate clean energy procurement pledge to eliminate \textit{all} greenhouse gas emissions associated with their electricity use. These companies declare the \enquote{24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (\gls{cfe})} goal aiming to match electricity demand with clean energy supply on an \textit{hourly basis}. The 24/7 targets were announced by Google, Microsoft, and Iron Mountain for 2030 and 2040, respectively \cite{google-247by2030, Microsoft-vision, IronMountainSustainability}.

One notable feature of the 24/7 CFE goal is that it drives---and requires---a significant amount of carbon-free energy procurement. Recent research showed that achieving 24/7 CFE with a 100\% target (i.e., achiving 0~gCO$_2$ emissions per kWh) implies that companies need to rely on own resources procuded with PPAs, void of any electricity producerement from the local grid. \cite{riepinMeansCostsSystemlevel2023, riepin-zenodo-systemlevel247} It is because the local electricity mix in most regions and at most times does not have a strictly zero carbon content and therefore cannot contribute to 24/7 CFE.

Climate change is driving a global effort to rapidly decarbonise electricity systems across the globe.
