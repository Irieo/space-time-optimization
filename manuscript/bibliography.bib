  abstract = {This work presents an estimation of the global electricity usage that can be ascribed to Communication Technology (CT) between 2010 and 2030. The scope is three scenarios for use and production of consumer devices, communication networks and data centers. Three different scenarios, best, expected, and worst, are set up, which include annual numbers of sold devices, data traffic and electricity intensities/efficiencies. The most significant trend, regardless of scenario, is that the proportion of use-stage electricity by consumer devices will decrease and will be transferred to the networks and data centers. Still, it seems like wireless access networks will not be the main driver for electricity use. The analysis shows that for the worst-case scenario, CT could use as much as 51\% of global electricity in 2030. This will happen if not enough improvement in electricity efficiency of wireless access networks and fixed access networks/data centers is possible. However, until 2030, globally-generated renewable electricity is likely to exceed the electricity demand of all networks and data centers. Nevertheless, the present investigation suggests, for the worst-case scenario, that CT electricity usage could contribute up to 23\% of the globally released greenhouse gas emissions in 2030.},

PyPSA includes models for conventional generators with unit commitment, variable renewable generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current networks. It is designed to be easily extensible and to scale well with large networks and long time series. In this paper the basic functionality of PyPSA is described, including the formulation of the full power flow equations and the multi-period optimisation of operation and investment with linear power flow equations. PyPSA is positioned in the existing free software landscape as a bridge between traditional power flow analysis tools for steady-state analysis and full multi-period energy system models. The functionality is demonstrated on two open datasets of the transmission system in Germany (based on SciGRID) and Europe (based on GridKit).~Funding statement: This research was conducted as part of the CoNDyNet project, which is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research under grant no. 03SF0472C.

  abstract = {Demand-side flexibility (DSF) in the electricity grid has become an active research area in recent years. While temporal flexibility (e.g. load shedding, load shifting) is already discussed intensively in literature, spatial load migration still is an under-researched type of DSF. Spatial load migration allows us to instantly migrate powerconsuming activities among different locations. Data centers (DCs) are power-intensive and process information goods. Since information goods are easily transferable through communication networks, power-intensive processing of information goods is not necessarily tied to a specific location. Consequently, geographically distributed DCs inherit{\textemdash}in theory{\textemdash}a considerable potential to globally migrate load. We analyze the economics of spatially migrating load to provide balancing power using geographically distributed DCs. We assure that neither of the participating electricity grids will be burdened by this mechanism. By using historical data to evaluate our model, we find reasonable economic incentives to migrate positive as well as negative balancing power. In addition, we find that current scenarios favor the migration of negative balancing power. Our research thus reveals realistic opportunities to virtually transfer balancing power between different market areas worldwide.},

  abstract = {The reduction of energy consumption in large-scale datacenters is being accomplished through an extensive use of virtualization, which enables the consolidation of multiple workloads in a smaller number of machines. Nevertheless, virtualization also incurs some additional overheads (e.g. virtual machine creation and migration) that can influence what is the best consolidated configuration, and thus, they must be taken into account. In this paper, we present a dynamic job scheduling policy for power-aware resource allocation in a virtualized datacenter. Our policy tries to consolidate workloads from separate machines into a smaller number of nodes, while fulfilling the amount of hardware resources needed to preserve the quality of service of each job. This allows turning off the spare servers, thus reducing the overall datacenter power consumption. As a novelty, this policy incorporates all the virtualization overheads in the decision process. In addition, our policy is prepared to consider other important parameters for a datacenter, such as reliability or dynamic SLA enforcement, in a synergistic way with power consumption. The introduced policy is evaluated comparing it against common policies in a simulated environment that accurately models HPC jobs execution in a virtualized datacenter including power consumption modeling and obtains a power consumption reduction of 15\% with respect to typical policies.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the question of the energy consumption of data centers has become more and more important, and several studies raised the possibility of using renewable energy to power them. The intermittent nature of commonly used renewable energy sources is a major drawback of using them directly on-site. In this paper, we present an approach for scheduling batch jobs with due date constraints, which takes into account the availability of the renewable energy to reduce the need of brown energy and therefore running cost. The approach we propose differs from the existing methods by providing a scheduling algorithm agnostic of the electrical infrastructure. A separated system, managing the renewable sources, provides an arbitrary objective function, which is used to guide the scheduling heuristic. We implemented our approach in a data center simulator, and evaluated it by considering a small-scale center powered with solar panels and connected to the electrical grid. The relationship between the flexibility allowed by the user negotiated SLAs and the behavior of the algorithm is studied, and compared to existing approaches from the literature. Our experiments show a reduction of brown energy consumption up to 49\% and a cost saving up to 51\%, compared to a traditional scheduler unaware of renewable availability.},

In this paper, we propose a new way to achieve an explicit trade-off between operational cost and carbon emission by dynamic storing off-site renewable energy in distributed data centers. We first formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem for cost minimization of data centers. Then, by leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we design an online Carbon Capped Cost Minimization algorithm (CCCM) to achieve a near-optimal cost with rigorous mathematical proof. Specially, the decisions at each time slot are determined with an efficient iterative algorithm based on the Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD) technique. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to show the effectiveness of our algorithm. The results show that our algorithm can save about 6\% total costs compared with the algorithm without offsite energy storage.},

The model is suitable both for operational studies and generation and transmission expansion planning studies. The continental scope and highly resolved spatial scale enables a proper description of the long-range smoothing effects for renewable power generation and their varying resource availability. The restriction to freely available and open data encourages the open exchange of model data developments and eases the comparison of model results. A further novelty of the dataset is the publication of the full, automated software pipeline to assemble the load-flow-ready model from the original datasets, which enables easy replacement and improvement of the individual parts. This paper focuses on the description of the network topology, the compilation of a European power plant database and a top-down load time-series regionalisation. It summarises the derivation of renewable wind and solar availability time-series from re-analysis weather datasets and the estimation of renewable capacity potentials restricted by land-use.

A key feature of the OSeMOSYS implementation is that it is contained in less than five pages of documented, easily accessible code. Other existing energy system models that do not have this emphasis on compactness and openness makes the barrier to entry by new users much higher, as well as making the addition of innovative new functionality very difficult. The paper begins by describing the rationale for the development of OSeMOSYS and its structure. The current preliminary implementation of the model is then demonstrated for a discrete example. Next, we explain how new development efforts will build on the existing OSeMOSYS codebase. The paper closes with thoughts regarding the organization of the OSeMOSYS community, associated capacity development efforts, and linkages to other open source efforts including adding functionality to the LEAP model.},

Data centers have a unique ability to shift computing load between different geographical locations, giving rise to geographic load flexibility that can be employed to reduce carbon emissions. In this paper, we present a model where data centers shift load independently of the ISOs. We first consider the impact of load shifting guided by locational marginal carbon emissions, denoted by \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{CO\}\_2\}\$, a sensitivity metric that measures the impact of incremental load shifts. Relative to previous models for data center load shifting, the presented model improves accuracy and include more realistic assumptions regarding the operation of both data centers and the electricity market. Further, we introduce a new benchmark model in which data centers have access to the full information about the power system and can identify optimal shifts for the current time period. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on the IEEE RTS GMLC system using 5 minute load and generation data for an entire year. Our results show that the proposed accuracy improvements for the shifting model based on \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{CO\}\_2\}\$ are highly effective, leading to results that outperform the benchmark model.},

The objective of the present study is to present estimates for the 2020 use stage electricity consumption and ICT sector's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions divided in three main parts user devices, networks and data centers. The study builds on a high number of data sources including measured and reported data from 150 companies that cover about 80\% of network subscriptions, an estimated about 55\% of datacenter electricity, and about 35\% of upstream GHG emissions. To understand the development, the results are put into the perspective of earlier studies. In conclusion, the ICT sector used about 4\% of the global electricity in the use stage and represented about 1.4\% of the global GHG emissions in 2020. The user devices including internet-of-things accounted for over half of all GHG emissions, with equal parts relating to use stage and other lifecycle stages. For networks and data centers, the use stage GHG emissions are dominating. The electricity consumption in use stage and the total GHG emissions have increased since 2015, but the impact per subscriber has decreased. The electricity consumption and GHG emissions are also estimated for the closely related areas Entertainment and Media (E\&M) including e.g., TVs and paper media, and the new area of cryptocurrencies.},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing demand for web applications deployed across multiple data centers results in large electricity costs for service providers and significant impact on the environment. This has motivated service providers to move towards more sustainable data centers powered by renewable or green sources of energy, such as solar or wind. However, efficient utilization of green energy to service web applications is a challenging problem due to intermittency and unpredictability of both application workload and renewable energy availability. One possible solution to reduce cost and increase renewable energy utilization is to exploit the spatio-temporal variations in on-site power and grid power prices by balancing the load among multiple data centers geographically distributed. In this paper, we propose a framework for reactive load balancing of web application requests among Geo-distributed sustainable data centers based on the availability of renewable energy sources on each site. A system prototype is developed, its underlying design and algorithms are described, and experiments are conducted with it using real infrastructure (Grid'5000 in France) and workload traces (real traffic to English Wikipedia). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reduce cost and brown energy usage with efficient utilization of green energy and without a priori knowledge of future workload, availability of renewable energy, and grid electricity prices.},

  abstract = {The amount of CO2 emitted per kilowatt-hour on an electricity grid varies by time of day and substantially varies by location due to the types of generation. Networked collections of warehouse scale computers, sometimes called Hyperscale Computing, emit more carbon than needed if operated without regard to these variations in carbon intensity. This paper introduces Google's system for Carbon-Intelligent Compute Management, which actively minimizes electricity-based carbon footprint and power infrastructure costs by delaying temporally flexible workloads. The core component of the system is a suite of analytical pipelines used to gather the next day's carbon intensity forecasts, train day-ahead demand prediction models, and use risk-aware optimization to generate the next day's carbon-aware Virtual Capacity Curves (VCCs) for all datacenter clusters across Google's fleet. VCCs impose hourly limits on resources available to temporally flexible workloads while preserving overall daily capacity, enabling all such workloads to complete within a day. Data from operation shows that VCCs effectively limit hourly capacity when the grid's energy supply mix is carbon intensive and delay the execution of temporally flexible workloads to ``greener'' times.},

In this study, we explore how and why~space-time load-shifting flexibility can be used to meet high 24/7 carbon-free energy targets, as well as what potential benefits it may offer to 24/7 participants and to the rest of the energy system.~To answer these questions, we expand the mathematical model of 24/7 CFE procurement~developed in the previous work by incorporating spatial and temporal demand flexibility~provided by electricity consumers that follow 24/7 carbon-free energy goals. The space-time flexibility is based on the example of data centers; the findings related to temporal flexibility~are generally applicable to a wide range of companies with flexible demand. This study is done in a spirit of open and reproducible research. The whole scientific workflow from the publicly available raw input data to optimized electricity system, visualizations and compilation of this study is available at GitHub.~The supplementary materials uploaded to this repository alongside the study~include all modelling results~in a form of plots and summary CSV files.

  abstract = {The huge energy consumption of datacenters providing cloud services over the Internet has motivated different studies regarding cost savings in datacenters. Since energy expenditure is a predominant part of the total operational expenditures for datacenter operators, energy aware policies for minimizing datacenters' energy consumption try to minimize energy costs while guaranteeing a certain quality of experience (QoE). Federated datacenters can take advantage of its geographically distributed infrastructure by managing appropriately the green energy resources available in each datacenter at a given time, in combination with workload consolidation and virtual machine migration policies. In this scenario, inter-datacenter networks play an important role and communications cost must be considered when minimizing operational expenditures. In this work we tackle the Elastic Operations in Federated Datacenter for Performance and Cost Optimization (ELFADO) problem for scheduling workload orchestrating federated datacenters. Two approaches, distributed and centralized, are studied and integer linear programming (ILP) formulations and heuristics are provided. Using those heuristics, we analyze cost savings with respect to a fixed workload placement. For the sake of a compelling analysis, exhaustive simulation experiments are carried out considering realistic scenarios. Results show that the centralized ELFADO approach can save up to 52\% of energy cost and more than 44\% when communication costs are also considered.},

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of cloud services, huge energy consumption of the underlying large-scale datacenters becomes a major concern of both the resource providers and the society. Datacenter owners are beginning to use renewable energy as extra supply for the devices. In this paper, we design a green-aware power management strategy for such datacenters powered by sustainable energy sources, considering the power consumption of both IT functional devices and cooling devices. Specifically, we make use of energy-aware methods to formulate an overall optimization problem, and try to solve it by combining heuristic and statistical searching approaches. The ultimate objective is to utilize green energy sufficiently while keeping the demand of applications deployed inside the datacenter at an acceptable level. Performance evaluation and simulation experiments are designed upon a simulated testbed, with realistic workload traces and solar energy generation considered, in order to validate the feasibility of our approach. Results show that it can significantly improve the green energy utilization, and achieve the highest overall revenues for the resource provider.},

Central to our study is the concept of virtual links, which provide non-physical pathways that can be used by DaCes to shift power loads (by shifting computing loads) across space and time. We use virtual links to show that the clearing formulation treats DaCes as prosumers that simultaneously request load and provide a load-shifting flexibility service.

We also show that DaCe flexibility helps relieve space{\textendash}time price volatility and show that the clearing formulation satisfies fundamental properties that are expected from coordinated markets (e.g., provides a competitive equilibrium and achieves revenue adequacy and cost recovery).
